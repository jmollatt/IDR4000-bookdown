	abstract = {There is solid evidence on the cross-training phenomenon, but the training load required to achieve it has yet to be established. The aim of this meta-analysis was to deduce which unilateral strength training load (duration, frequency, intensity, rest and type) would enable the biggest strength increases to be obtained in the inactive contralateral limb. The examined studies were limited to those written in the English language within the Web of Science, {PubMed} and {SPORTDiscus} databases. Ten of the 43 eligible studies were included, covering a total of 409 participants. The studies included in the meta-analysis showed a low risk of bias and had an estimated pooled effect size of 0.56 (95\% {CI} from 0.34 to 0.78). Greater effect sizes were observed in lengthy protocols involving fast eccentric exercises using designs of 3 sets of 10 repetitions and a 2-minute rest time. Effect size did not relate to absolute volume, relative intensity, absolute duration and speed of execution. In conclusion, to optimize contralateral strength improvements, cross-training sessions should involve fast eccentric sets with moderate volumes and rest intervals., 
          
            
              Key points
            
            
              
                Inter-limb transfer of the strength is more effective in high speed eccentric exercises.
              
              
                Muscular endurance training is not advisable to induce contralateral adaptations.
              
              
                Cross-education effect may depend more on volume of training than on load.},

	abstract = {The optimal scheduling of Nordic Hamstring exercises ({NHEs}) relative to football  training sessions is unknown. We examined the acute neuromuscular and performance responses to {NHE} undertaken either before ({BT}) or after ({AT}) simulated football training. Twelve amateur players performed six sets of five repetitions of the {NHE} either before or after 60 min of standardised football-specific exercise ({SAFT}(60)). Surface electromyography signals ({EMG}) of the hamstring muscles were  recorded during both the {NHE}, and maximum eccentric actions of the knee flexors (0.52 rad . s(-1)) performed before and after the {NHE} programme, and at 15 min intervals during {SAFT}(60). Ten-metre sprint times were recorded on three occasions during each 15 min {SAFT}(60) segment. Greater eccentric hamstring fatigue following the {NHE} programme was observed in {BT} versus {AT} (19.8 \%; very likely small effect), which was particularly apparent in the latter range of knee flexion (0-15 degrees ; 39.6\%; likely moderate effect), and synonymous with hamstring {EMG} declines (likely small-likely moderate effects). Performing {NHE} {BT}  attenuated sprint performance declines (2.0-3.2\%; likely small effects), but decreased eccentric hamstring peak torque (-14.1 to -18.9\%; likely small effects) during football-specific exercise. Performing {NHE} prior to football training reduces eccentric hamstring strength and may exacerbate hamstring injury risk.},

	abstract = {Immobilization due to hospitalization and major surgery leads to an increased risk of morbidity, disability and a decline in muscle function especially in frail elderly individuals. In fact, many elderly patients fail to regain their level of function and self-care before admission to hospital. Given that reduced lower limb muscle strength and loss of skeletal muscle mass (i.e. sarcopenia) have been associated with functional impairments and disability with aging, attempts to counteract this process seem highly relevant. In recent years, strength training has emerged as an effective method to induce muscle hypertrophy and increase muscle strength and functional performance in frail elderly individuals. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that strength training is an effective method to restore muscle function in post-operative patients and in patients with chronic diseases. Despite this, strength training is rarely used in the rehabilitation of hospitalized elderly patients. The current knowledge on this topic will be the focus of this review.},
