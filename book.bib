	abstract = {The role of science in policymaking has gained unprecedented stature in the United States, raising questions about the place of science and scientific expertise in the democratic process. Some scientists have been given considerable epistemic authority in shaping policy on issues of great moral and cultural significance, and the politicizing of these issues has become highly contentious. Since World War {II}, most philosophers of science have purported the concept that science should be "value-free." In Science, Policy and the Value-Free Ideal, Heather E. Douglas argues that such an ideal is neither adequate nor desirable for science. She contends that the moral responsibilities of scientists require the consideration of values even at the heart of science. She lobbies for a new ideal in which values serve an essential function throughout scientific inquiry, but where the role values play is constrained at key points, thus protecting the integrity and objectivity of science. In this vein, Douglas outlines a system for the application of values to guide scientists through points of uncertainty fraught with moral valence. Following a philosophical analysis of the historical background of science advising and the value-free ideal, Douglas defines how values should-and should not-function in science. She discusses the distinctive direct and indirect roles for values in reasoning, and outlines seven senses of objectivity, showing how each can be employed to determine the reliability of scientific claims. Douglas then uses these philosophical insights to clarify the distinction between junk science and sound science to be used in policymaking. In conclusion, she calls for greater openness on the values utilized in policymaking, and more public participation in the policymaking process, by suggesting various models for effective use of both the public and experts in key risk assessments.},

This book provides an introduction and overview of many of the social, ethical, and legal issues facing scientists today. The book includes chapters on research misconduct, conflicts of interest, data management, mentoring, authorship, peer review, publication, intellectual property, research with human subjects, research with animal subjects, genetic and stem cell research, international research, and ethical decision making. The book also features dozens of real and hypothetical cases for discussion and analysis and introduces the reader to important research regulations and guidelines. Now in its second edition, this book synthesizes the diverse talents and experiences. This second edition of this book includes new chapters and cases and has been brought up to date on the latest issues and problems in research ethics.},

	shorttitle = {A cherry tree ripe for picking},
	abstract = {Background The acute chronic workload ratio ({ACWR}) is widely used to evaluate the relationship between training load and health problems. However, both {ACWR} and health problems can be defined in many ways, and how these methodological choices affect the relationship is unclear.
Aim To investigate whether different results emerge when different definitions of {ACWR} and health problems are used.
Methods An online questionnaire was used to collect daily health and training information from 86 elite youth footballers for 105 days. The relationship between players’ training load and health was analysed using a range of different definitions of {ACWR} and health problem. We used a 21-day and 28-day chronic period, coupled and uncoupled calculations, and exponentially weighted moving average ({EWMA}) and rolling average ({RA}). {ACWR} data were categorized into three bins (low, medium and high) using pre-defined categories and z-scores, and we compared medium to high, medium to low and low to high categories. The outcome was defined in three ways: “all health problems”, “all injuries”, and “new non-contact injuries”. We performed a total of 108 separate random-effects logistic regression analyses.
Results We recorded 6250 training days and 196 health problems. Of the 108 analyses performed, 21 (19\%) identified a statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05) association between {ACWR} and health problems. A greater proportion of associations were identified when using an “all health problems” definition (33\% of analyses), when comparing low and high categories (31\%), and using {EWMA} (28\%).
Conclusions The relationship between {ACWR} and health problems was highly dependent on methodological approach.},

	shorttitle = {Why methods matter in a meta-analysis},
	abstract = {Objectives
The Nordic hamstring exercise ({NHE}) has been strongly recommended to reduce hamstring injuries in previous meta-analyses (50\% reduction in risk of injury). To underline the importance and impact of adopting appropriate methodology for evidence synthesis, we revisited the study selection, reanalyzed and updated the findings of the most recent meta-analysis.
Study Design and Setting
Only randomized control trials ({RCT}) using {NHE} as one of the prevention arms were selected. Summary effects for risk ratios ({RR}) for original studies included in the earlier meta-analysis, and new studies identified (update), were re-estimated under the random-effects model and presented with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) and prediction intervals ({PI}). Tentative recommendations were provided according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation.
Results
Only five {RCTs} out of the 15 studies included in the earlier meta-analysis randomized to {NHE}. Our update revealed one additional {RCT}. The point estimate ({RR}) for the five {RCTs} previously considered {RCTs} was 0.56 (95\% {CI}, 0.20–1.52; 95\% {PI}, 0.06–5.14, parametric, and 0.13–1.80, nonparametric). After the update, the {RR} was 0.59 (95\% {CI}, 0.27–1.29; 95\% {PI} 0.10–3.29, parametric, and 0.17–1.52, nonparametric).
Conclusion
Contrary to the conclusions of a recent meta-analysis, as well as earlier meta-analyses, by using more appropriate methodology, the evidence underpinning the protective effect of {NHE} so far remains inconclusive and mostly derived from high risk of bias {RCTs}. At best, only conditional recommendation can be provided (for soccer) and future {RCTs} are warranted.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hamstring injuries are the most common muscle injuries in soccer, and they have a high rate of recurrence. Eccentric hamstrings strength is recognized as an important modifiable risk factor. This led to the development of prevention exercises such as the nordic hamstring exercise ({NHE}). The effectiveness of the {NHE} on hamstring injury prevention has never been investigated in amateur soccer.
{PURPOSE}: To investigate the preventive effect of the {NHE} on the incidence and severity of hamstring injuries in male amateur soccer players.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
{METHODS}: Male amateur soccer players (age, mean ± {SD}, 24.5 ± 3.8 years) from 40 teams were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 20 teams, 292 players) or control group (n = 20 teams, 287 players). The intervention group was instructed to perform 25 sessions of {NHE} in a 13-week period. Both the intervention and control groups performed regular soccer training and were followed for hamstring injury incidence and severity during the 2013 calendar year. At baseline, personal characteristics (eg, age, injury history, field position) were gathered from all participants via a questionnaire. Primary outcome was injury incidence. Secondary outcomes were injury severity and compliance with the intervention protocol.
{RESULTS}: A total of 38 hamstring injuries were recorded, affecting 36 of 579 players (6.2\%). The overall injury incidence rate was 0.7 (95\% {CI}, 0.6-0.8) per 1000 player hours, 0.33 (95\% {CI}, 0.25-0.46) in training, and 1.2 (95\% {CI}, 0.82-1.94) in matches. Injury incidence rates were significantly different between the intervention (0.25; 95\% {CI}, 0.19-0.35) and control groups (0.8; 95\% {CI}, 0.61-1.15), χ(2)(1, n = 579) = 7.865; P = .005. The risk for hamstring injuries was reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 0.282; 95\% {CI}, 0.110-0.721) and was statistically significant (P = .005). No statistically significant differences were identified between the intervention and control groups regarding injury severity. Compliance with the intervention protocol was 91\%.
{CONCLUSION}: Incorporating the {NHE} protocol in regular amateur training significantly reduces hamstring injury incidence, but it does not reduce hamstring injury severity. Compliance with the intervention was excellent.},

	abstract = {Aim Investigate whether acute workload (1 week total distance) and chronic workload (4-week average acute workload) predict injury in elite rugby league players.
Methods Data were collected from 53 elite players over two rugby league seasons. The ‘acute:chronic workload ratio’ was calculated by dividing acute workload by chronic workload. A value of greater than 1 represented an acute workload greater than chronic workload. All workload data were classified into discrete ranges by z-scores.
Results Compared with all other ratios, a very-high acute:chronic workload ratio (≥2.11) demonstrated the greatest risk of injury in the current week (16.7\% injury risk) and subsequent week (11.8\% injury risk). High chronic workload ({\textgreater}16 095 m) combined with a very-high 2-week average acute:chronic workload ratio (≥1.54) was associated with the greatest risk of injury (28.6\% injury risk). High chronic workload combined with a moderate workload ratio (1.02–1.18) had a smaller risk of injury than low chronic workload combined with several workload ratios (relative risk range from 0.3 to 0.7×/÷1.4 to 4.4; likelihood range=88–94\%, likely). Considering acute and chronic workloads in isolation (ie, not as ratios) did not consistently predict injury risk.
Conclusions Higher workloads can have either positive or negative influences on injury risk in elite rugby league players. Specifically, compared with players who have a low chronic workload, players with a high chronic workload are more resistant to injury with moderate-low through moderate-high (0.85–1.35) acute:chronic workload ratios and less resistant to injury when subjected to ‘spikes’ in acute workload, that is, very-high acute:chronic workload ratios ∼1.5.},

	abstract = {The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data, or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, “cooking” of data, etc… Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7, 95\%{CI}: 0.86–4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N = 12, 95\% {CI}: 9.91–19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words “falsification” or “fabrication”, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

	abstract = {Kaplan-Meier estimate is one of the best options to be used to measure the fraction of subjects living for a certain amount of time after treatment. In clinical trials or community trials, the effect of an intervention is assessed by measuring the number of subjects survived or saved after that intervention over a period of time. The time starting from a defined point to the occurrence of a given event, for example death is called as survival time and the analysis of group data as survival analysis. This can be affected by subjects under study that are uncooperative and refused to be remained in the study or when some of the subjects may not experience the event or death before the end of the study, although they would have experienced or died if observation continued, or we lose touch with them midway in the study. We label these situations as censored observations. The Kaplan-Meier estimate is the simplest way of computing the survival over time in spite of all these difficulties associated with subjects or situations. The survival curve can be created assuming various situations. It involves computing of probabilities of occurrence of event at a certain point of time and multiplying these successive probabilities by any earlier computed probabilities to get the final estimate. This can be calculated for two groups of subjects and also their statistical difference in the survivals. This can be used in Ayurveda research when they are comparing two drugs and looking for survival of subjects.},

	abstract = {Background International literature recognises that sports people who have sustained an injury have a high likelihood of a subsequent injury, either of the same type again or a different one. Taking into account the dependency of subsequent injuries within athletes is important, otherwise, results have greater precision than is warranted and there is possible biassing of results away from the null. Survival methods for recurrent events data can be applied to take into account the potential statistical relationships between subsequent injuries. Various survival analysis approaches exist and the selection of a correct model is important. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate the appropriate use of survival analysis methods in sports injury incidence studies.
Methods The review was performed and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses ({PRISMA}) Statement, comprising a traditional systematic search of literature and a hand search of key sports medicine journals. Descriptive data on the studies were extracted (e.g. aim, setting, follow up) along with detailed information on the reported survival analysis methods. The appropriateness of selected models, and their reporting, were examined in-depth.
Results There were 699 publications screened from which 123 were included for further review. Studies were mainly focused on the reported time to first injury (n = 53\%) or the time to recover/return to play after injury (19\%). Recurrent or subsequent injuries were only considered in 10\% of papers. Graphical approaches (Kaplan-Meier curves) were most commonly used (51\% of studies), along with simple univariate (30\%) and Cox-regression techniques (88\%).
Conclusions While a number of researchers have used survival methods for analysis of sports injury data, there is scope for improvement in the statistical approaches used and, specifcally, in the reporting of subsequent injuries.},

	abstract = {Background
Time-to-event modelling is underutilised in sports injury research. Still, sports injury researchers have been encouraged to consider time-to-event analyses as a powerful alternative to other statistical methods. Therefore, it is important to shed light on statistical approaches suitable for analysing training load related key-questions within the sports injury domain.

Content
In the present article, we illuminate: (i) the possibilities of including time-varying outcomes in time-to-event analyses, (ii) how to deal with a situation where different types of sports injuries are included in the analyses (ie, competing risks), and (iii) how to deal with the situation where multiple subsequent injuries occur in the same athlete.

Conclusion
Time-to-event analyses can handle time-varying outcomes, competing risk and multiple subsequent injuries. Although powerful, time-to-event has important requirements: researchers are encouraged to carefully consider prior to any data collection that five injuries per exposure state or transition is needed to avoid conducting statistical analyses on time-to-event data leading to biased results. This requirement becomes particularly difficult to accommodate when a stratified analysis is required as the number of variables increases exponentially for each additional strata included. In future sports injury research, we need stratified analyses if the target of our research is to respond to the question: ‘how much change in training load is too much before injury is sustained, among athletes with different characteristics?’ Responding to this question using multiple time-varying exposures (and outcomes) requires millions of injuries. This should not be a barrier for future research, but collaborations across borders to collecting the amount of data needed seems to be an important step forward.},

	abstract = {The optimal scheduling of Nordic Hamstring exercises ({NHEs}) relative to football  training sessions is unknown. We examined the acute neuromuscular and performance responses to {NHE} undertaken either before ({BT}) or after ({AT}) simulated football training. Twelve amateur players performed six sets of five repetitions of the {NHE} either before or after 60 min of standardised football-specific exercise ({SAFT}(60)). Surface electromyography signals ({EMG}) of the hamstring muscles were  recorded during both the {NHE}, and maximum eccentric actions of the knee flexors (0.52 rad . s(-1)) performed before and after the {NHE} programme, and at 15 min intervals during {SAFT}(60). Ten-metre sprint times were recorded on three occasions during each 15 min {SAFT}(60) segment. Greater eccentric hamstring fatigue following the {NHE} programme was observed in {BT} versus {AT} (19.8 \%; very likely small effect), which was particularly apparent in the latter range of knee flexion (0-15 degrees ; 39.6\%; likely moderate effect), and synonymous with hamstring {EMG} declines (likely small-likely moderate effects). Performing {NHE} {BT}  attenuated sprint performance declines (2.0-3.2\%; likely small effects), but decreased eccentric hamstring peak torque (-14.1 to -18.9\%; likely small effects) during football-specific exercise. Performing {NHE} prior to football training reduces eccentric hamstring strength and may exacerbate hamstring injury risk.},

	abstract = {Immobilization due to hospitalization and major surgery leads to an increased risk of morbidity, disability and a decline in muscle function especially in frail elderly individuals. In fact, many elderly patients fail to regain their level of function and self-care before admission to hospital. Given that reduced lower limb muscle strength and loss of skeletal muscle mass (i.e. sarcopenia) have been associated with functional impairments and disability with aging, attempts to counteract this process seem highly relevant. In recent years, strength training has emerged as an effective method to induce muscle hypertrophy and increase muscle strength and functional performance in frail elderly individuals. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that strength training is an effective method to restore muscle function in post-operative patients and in patients with chronic diseases. Despite this, strength training is rarely used in the rehabilitation of hospitalized elderly patients. The current knowledge on this topic will be the focus of this review.},
